# Children-Bone-Marrow-Transplant


About the dataset The dataset describes pediatric patients with several hematologic diseases: malignant disorders (i.a. patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with acute myelogenous leukemia, with chronic myelogenous leukemia, with myelodysplastic syndrome) and nonmalignant cases (i.a. patients with severe aplastic anemia, with Fanconi anemia, with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy). All patients were subject to the unmanipulated allogeneic unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The motivation of this study was to identify the most important factors influencing the success or failure of the transplantation procedure. In particular, verification of the research hypothesis that increased dosage of CD34+ cells / kg extends overall survival time without simultaneous occurrence of undesirable events affecting patients' quality of life.

Dataset information The set contains 187 examples characterized by 37 attributes. The meaning of the following features is as follows: -Recipientgender - Male - 1, Female - 0,

IIIV - Development of acute graft versus host disease stage II or III or IV (Yes - 1, No - 0),
Gendermatch - Compatibility of the donor and recipient according to their gender (Female to Male - 1, Other - 0),
DonorABO - ABO blood group of the donor of hematopoietic stem cells (0 - 0, 1, A, B=-1, AB=2),
RecipientABO - ABO blood group of the recipient of hematopoietic stem cells (0 - 0, 1, A, B=-1, AB=2),
RecipientRh - Presence of the Rh factor on recipientï¿½s red blood cells ('+' - 1, '-' - 0),
ABOMatch - Compatibility of the donor and the recipient of hematopoietic stem cells according to ABO blood group (matched - 1, mismatched - 1)
CMVstatus - Serological compatibility of the donor and the recipient of hematopoietic stem cells according to cytomegalovirus infection prior to transplantation (the higher the value the lower the compatibility)
RecipientCMV - Presence of cytomegalovirus infection in the donor of hematopoietic stem cells prior to transplantation (presence - 1, absence - 0)

Riskgroup - High risk - 1, Low risk - 0,
Txpostrelapse - The second bone marrow transplantation after relapse (No - 0; Yes - 1),
Diseasegroup - Type of disease (malignant - 1, nonmalignant - 0),
HLAmatch - Compatibility of antigens of the main histocompatibility complex of the donor and the recipient of hematopoietic stem cell according to ALL international BFM SCT 2008 criteria (10/10 - 0, 9/10 - 1, 8/10 - 2, 7/10 - 3 (allele/antigens)),
HLAmismatch - HLA matched - 0, HL mismatched - 1,
Antigen - In how many anigens there is difference beetwen the donor nad the recipient (-1 - no differences, 0 - one difference,1 (2) two (three) diffences)
Allel - In how many allele there is difference beetwen the donor nad the recipient {-1 no differences,0 - one difference, 1 (2) (3) - two, (tree, four) differences)
HLAgrI - The differecne type beetwien the donor and the recipient (HLA mateched - 0,the difference is in only one antigen - 1, the difference is only in one allel - 2, the difference is only in DRB1 cell - 3, two differences (two allele or two antignes) - 4, two differences (two allele or two antignes) - 5),
